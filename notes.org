*** The Ugly Truth about Community, If you don't get involved in the Chef Community
    it's easy to get left behind [ Image of Chef from SouthPark ]
  - Chef moves fast, real fast
  - 60% of the time that I write a cookbook, I find that someone has 
    already written a better one
  - One of the reasons I started Food Fight was to keep on top of what
    was happening in the community
  - So even if you hate freedom and you hate community
    You will be missing out if you don't get involved
